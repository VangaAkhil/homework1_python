Write a Python program in
Replit that reads a text file
(you can create a sample text
file) and counts the number
of words in it.
Implement
metaprogramming
techniques to dynamically
generate function names for
your pytest test cases based
on the filenames of the text
files.
Include pytest test cases that
verify the word count for
each text file
